# Drug-Name-Detection-and-Recommendation
This project integrates Drug Name Detection using computer vision with a Medicine Recommendation System powered by NLP.The pipeline uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect drug names in images and matches these names with a medical dataset to provide personalized medicine recommendations, including potential side effects. And used tools also like Transformers (Hugging Face) for generating drug recommendations.
This combination enables real-world applications like prescription validation and healthcare assistance.
