# Drug-Name-Detection-and-Recommendation
This project integrates Drug Name Detection using computer vision with a Medicine Recommendation System powered by NLP.The pipeline uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect drug names in images and matches these names with a medical dataset to provide personalized medicine recommendations, including potential side effects.

Tools and Technologies
YOLO (Ultralytics): A state-of-the-art object detection model used to identify drug names in images.
Transformers (Hugging Face): Pre-trained language models for generating drug recommendations.
Pandas: Data processing for the drug and medical dataset.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization of image detection results.
PyTorch: Framework for training and inference of both YOLO and recommendation models.
Datasets: Efficient handling and processing of medical data for the NLP system.
This combination enables real-world applications like prescription validation and healthcare assistance.
